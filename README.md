My Scrapyard
============

This is just a place where I put all the quick hacks and failed ideas.
The programs *do* work, more or less - so, I don't upload any old crap
here. It's just that they're buggy, incomplete, built on wrong assumptions
or just really really bad ideas.

I don't want to work on those programs anymore, but I also don't want
to just go and delete them. So here they are, may they rest in piece.

You may do anything you want with any files in this repository, including
but not limited to re-distributing or selling them (ha, good luck!).

You'll find a README in each sub-directory, telling you some things about
the hack in question.

The source code is mostly of pretty low quality - these are quick hacks,
after all.

Have fun!
