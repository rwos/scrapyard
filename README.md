My Scrapyard
============

This is just a place where I put all the quick hacks and failed ideas.
The programs *do* work, more or less - so, I don't upload any old crap
here. It's just that they're buggy, incomplete, built on wrong assumptions
or just really really bad ideas.

I don't want to work on those programs anymore, but I also don't want
to just go and delete them. So here they are, may they rest in piece.

You'll find a README in each sub-directory, telling you some things about
the hack in question.

The source code is mostly of pretty low quality - these are quick hacks,
after all.

Have fun!
